sequence:
- When child opens the application it has the prompt “let’s write a story about…” and it enters a character creation mode
    - Child enters name for character
    - “What does our character look like?”
        - Feed the response into an illustration generator
        - Child chooses from options or regenerates
    - “What is our character like?”
        - Child chooses from personality traits to keep things safe
        - Generates a paragraph and asks “does this seem like them?”
        - Parent confirms to ensure appropriateness and accuracy
- The application generates a story based on the previously set goals and asks the child at certain breaks what they think should happen
- The child has the opportunity to answer questions through narrative
    - Story about learning moral values, it would stop at a plot point and ask the child to decide what the character does
        - Good response gets positive points and the story continues
        - Poor response gets no points and the story continues, giving the child more opportunities to make the right choice
    - After the story concludes, it brings up what the child did right and praises them, takes a minute to talk about what happened when the choices were poor
- More points help indicate to the parent how well the child is progressing toward their learning goals
    - Think class dojo points !
